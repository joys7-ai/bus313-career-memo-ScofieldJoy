## Introduction
My name is Joy Scofield and I am a third year at Shidler double majoring in International Business and Marketing.
I was born in China, but was adopted and moved around due to the Army. I spent my formative years in Hawaii and Germany. 
I really enjoy travelling and trying new food places! I've discovered from a young age I love exploring new places and love talking to people!

The purpose of this memo is to address my career objectives and my challenges that I face and how I plan to overcome it. 

## Career Objectives
As I am finishing up my first semester of my third year, it is vital that I think about the future and what I want to do in regards to a career.
I have a love for talking to people and I am facinated about global marketing and the way that foreign products are marketed here and how we market in foreign markets.

By the end of my academic journey here, I hope to have a good enough foundation to be able to move to California and work in the marketing industry.
I would ideally love to be working for the tech or real estate business. Both industries are dynamic, fast-paced, and constantly evolving, which means I could bring creativity and energy to the work. I feel like in those two places I could really strive and put excitement into the industry!
I want to be successful and I really want to look for mentors and people to surround myself to get there.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges I face is just feeling like that I don't have enough connections to make it in this type of industry. 
I want to be able to have a lot of experience so that I am able to have opportunities, but that is difficult.
Another challenge is balancing my part-time jobs with schoolwork and extracurriculars. While these jobs give me valuable experience and teach me responsibility, they also limit the time I can spend on internships or networking events. I know that I will need to be strategic about how I use my time in the next few semesters.

I think I also I am not as in of a superior academic standing as my competition and peers. 

## Action Plan
My action plan for this is to just put my head down and work for the next three semesters, but also create my own portfolio to show employers. I plan to seek out internships, even short-term ones, to gain hands-on experience. I also want to attend networking events, career fairs, and workshops offered by Shidler to meet professionals in the field. Building a LinkedIn presence and connecting with alumni will also help me expand my network.
I want that my actual personality and work speak for me and though I may not have the best grades, I can use what I learned and actually apply it in the real world.

## AI & LLM Usage
I did not use any AI within this assignment. All of the work is solely my own. I followed the instructions on Lamaku and made this Github memo!!
